# Template type list library

This project contains an implementation of a library to deal with lists of types in C++.
Type lists are defined in a "nested style" and meta-functions to handle them and make predicates about them are contained there as well.

Note that those meta-functions are heavily inspired by the ones that are present in the standard library of the Haskell programming language.

*This project is more intended to be an exercise about template metaprogramming than a real attempt at a library.*
