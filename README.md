# Template list library

This project contains an implementation of a library to deal with lists of arguments in C++.
A certain number of meta-functions are defined to deal with variadic argument lists,
which are thus seen as lists.

Note that the meta-functions defined here are heavily inspired by the ones that are present
in the standard library of the Haskell programming language.

*This project is more intended to be an exercise about template metaprogramming than a real
attempt at a library.*
